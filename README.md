# Tree-Walker-and-Differentiator
A binary tree that is written in the MainGUI.java is printed. With the buttons, you can change the location of the pointer.
The buttons allows you to walk on the tree and let's you go to the root, first (biggest node), last (smallest node), 
  parent, left child, right child, previous (the closest smaller number), next (the closest bigger number) nodes.
Allows a user manipulate, evaluate, differentiate, and simplify polynomials represented by binary trees.
After each button clicked, the new (altered) tree is parsed again.
